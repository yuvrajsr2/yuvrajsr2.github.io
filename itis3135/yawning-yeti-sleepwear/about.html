    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Yawning Yeti Sleepwear started with a simple idea: bedtime should be as fun as it is comfortable. 
      Inspired by the legendary Yeti, who is always on the hunt for warmth and coziness, we designed a line 
      of sleepwear that makes nights feel mythical.
    </p>
    <p>
      From fuzzy pajamas and oversized hoodies to playful slippers and themed accessories, our mission is 
      to help you <strong>sleep like a legend</strong>. Whether you're lounging after a long day, gearing up for a sleepover, 
      or just want to add some magic to your nighttime routine, Yawning Yeti Sleepwear is here for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legend says the Yawning Yeti roams snowy mountains searching for the perfect pajamas… 
      but thanks to us, you won’t have to go that far.
